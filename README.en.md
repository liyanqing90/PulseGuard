  <strong>Continuously check pages, APIs, and network targets from one console while keeping evidence that helps explain failures.</strong>
</p>

PulseGuard is a local-first **UI/API probing and lightweight monitoring console** for individuals, small teams, and internal environments.

It combines scheduled checks, draft debugging, run history, failure evidence, health state, alerts, and distributed execution in a single-instance system. Typical targets include internal admin pages, login prerequisites, health endpoints, batch heartbeats, certificates, TCP/DNS, and basic network reachability.

PulseGuard is not a public status-page service, a full E2E test-management platform, or an incident/on-call system. It solves a narrower problem:

> When services are spread across local machines, LANs, and isolated networks, how can a team verify that they still work and distinguish a target failure from an execution-environment failure?

## Use cases

- Check internal pages that require login or setup context;
- Monitor APIs, health endpoints, and important response fields;
- Receive passive heartbeats from batch jobs, schedulers, or devices;
- Monitor TLS expiry, HTTP content, redirects, assets, TCP, and DNS;
- Coordinate local, LAN, and cross-network runners from one main node;
- Keep screenshots, response bodies, and optional Trace files for failed runs;
- Separate target failures from browser, runner, dependency, and database failures.

## Core capabilities

### UI and API probes

- Scheduled, manual, batch, and rerun execution;
- Structured UI steps, setup scripts, and multiple browser types;
- API request configuration, field preview, assertions, and advanced scripts;
- Draft runs that do not affect formal health or alert statistics.

### Trustworthy health state

PulseGuard does not treat every transient failure as an outage. The main transition is:

```text
healthy → suspected failure → failed → suspected recovery → healthy
```

It also models unknown, stale observation, and disabled states. Browser crashes, missing dependencies, runner unavailability, and database errors are classified as Runner failures rather than target failures.

### Evidence and trends

- Error summaries, screenshots, and response bodies;
- Optional Playwright Trace capture, disabled by default;
- 24-hour, 7-day, 30-day, and custom-range trends;
- Average successful latency, P95, P99, and failure counts;
- Rolling retention for repeated failures to prevent unbounded evidence growth.

### Distributed execution

PulseGuard supports three execution sources:

```text
main node
├── local: built-in local execution
├── direct worker: main node reaches a LAN worker directly
└── relay worker: worker connects outbound without exposing an inbound port
```

Multi-runner and multi-browser runs share a run group and retain runner state, browser type, failure source, duration, and evidence per result.

### Alerts and read-only outputs

- Separate target-execution alerts from system-failure alerts;
- Global, tag-level, and task-level alert policies;
- Cooldown and recovery notifications;
- JSON, Prometheus, and token-protected read-only snapshots;
- Config export, sanitized export, import preview, and version restoration.

## Quick start

Docker Compose is the recommended path:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/liyanqing90/PulseGuard.git
cd PulseGuard
docker compose up --build -d
```

The default published address is `0.0.0.0:8787`:

- Local: `http://127.0.0.1:8787`
- LAN: `http://<local IP>:8787`

Check the deployment:

```bash
docker compose ps
docker compose logs --tail 80 pulseguard
curl http://127.0.0.1:8787/api/health
```

To publish only on localhost:

```env
PULSEGUARD_PUBLISH_HOST=127.0.0.1
PULSEGUARD_HOST=0.0.0.0
PULSEGUARD_PORT=8787
PULSEGUARD_PUBLISH_PORT=8787
PULSEGUARD_ALERT_DETAIL_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8787
```

## Relay: outbound-only workers

Enable Relay on the main node:

```bash
export PULSEGUARD_RELAY_PUBLIC_HOST="<public host or IP>"
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.relay.yml up --build -d
```

Only the public TCP port `9443` is required by default. Workers do not publish `8788` on the host; the relay client connects outbound to the main node.

Relay uses self-signed TLS, server-fingerprint pinning, one-time deployment credentials, hashed/encrypted token storage, and an internal-only control network. See the [operations reference](./docs/operations-reference.en.md) for the complete model.

## Technology

| Layer | Technology |
| --- | --- |
| Backend | FastAPI, SQLite, Playwright Python, uv |
| Frontend | React, TypeScript, Vite, Ant Design |
| Runtime | Docker Compose or local processes |
| Storage | SQLite, `data/`, `reports/` |
| Remote execution | Direct workers and WebSocket Relay |

## Product boundaries

- Single-instance and local/LAN-first;
- SQLite by default, with no required external database;
- Workers execute tasks but do not own scheduling, alerts, or source-of-truth data;
- Custom Python scripts are trusted local capabilities, not a security sandbox;
- Evidence uses retention policies rather than permanent full-artifact storage;
- Recording is not the primary path; structured rules, templates, and setup scripts are preferred.
